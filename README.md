# Conway's Game of Life Simulator

A real-time, interactive simulation of **Conway's Game of Life**, built with Windows Forms in .NET. The program allows users to explore cellular automata dynamics on a customizable toroid field, design their own patterns, and experiment with classic structures.

## Features
- 🌍 **Language Support**: Available in **German**, **English**, **French**, and **Spanish**  
- ⚙️ **Toroid Field**: Customizable wrap-around (toroidal) simulation grid  
- 🧩 **Interactive Tools**: Create, modify, and paste your own structures directly into the simulation  
- 📚 **Built-in Examples**: Includes basic and classic Game of Life structures  
- 🎮 **Real-Time Control**: Pause, step, or run the simulation at adjustable speeds  

## Installation & Usage
1. **Unpack** the provided ZIP archive.  
2. **Run** the file: `Conway's GOL.exe`.  

That’s it! You’re ready to start experimenting with Conway’s Game of Life.

## About
This project was developed using **Windows Forms in .NET**, focusing on accessibility, simplicity, and interactive learning. It combines classic cellular automata with modern multilingual support and powerful editing tools.
